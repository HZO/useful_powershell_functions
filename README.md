It contains functions from different areas like:

**..., just check the content of this repository..btw if you are looking for some easy to use tool to manage PowerShell content in you AD, check my [PowerShell CI/CD repository](https://github.com/ztrhgf/Powershell_CICD_repository)**

PS: ps1 files here are from 99% functions i.e. you have to dot source (run) the ps1 script and then call the function (defined in such ps1)!
